## **Project Description**
A rotary engine, also known as a Wankel engine, is a type of internal combustion engine that uses a rotor instead of pistons to convert pressure into rotating motion. This project focuses on designing a functional rotary engine model and simulating its behavior using SolidWorks Simulation. The design includes all major components, such as the rotor, housing, eccentric shaft, and intake/exhaust ports, ensuring a realistic representation of a rotary engine.

## **Components of the Rotary Engine**
Below is a detailed description of each component in the rotary engine design:

### 1. **Rotor**
   - The rotor is the heart of the rotary engine, responsible for converting combustion pressure into rotational motion.
   - Designed with three lobes to ensure smooth operation and optimal compression.
   - Material: High-strength alloy steel.

### 2. **Housing**
   - The housing encloses the rotor and forms the combustion chambers.
   - Features intake and exhaust ports for air-fuel mixture and exhaust gases.
   - Material: Aluminum alloy for lightweight and heat dissipation.

### 3. **Eccentric Shaft**
   - The eccentric shaft transfers the rotational motion of the rotor to the output shaft.
   - Designed with precision to ensure minimal vibration and wear.
   - Material: Carbon steel for durability.

### 4. **Intake and Exhaust Ports**
   - The intake port allows the air-fuel mixture to enter the combustion chamber.
   - The exhaust port expels the burnt gases after combustion.
   - Designed for optimal flow efficiency.

### 5. **Spark Plugs**
   - Located in the housing, the spark plugs ignite the air-fuel mixture.
   - Positioned strategically for efficient combustion.

### 6. **Seals and Apex Seals**
   - Seals are used to prevent leakage between combustion chambers.
   - Apex seals are critical for maintaining compression and efficiency.
   - Material: High-temperature-resistant ceramic.
